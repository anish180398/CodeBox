Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: []
```
