You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.

Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```
